                        family’s retail furniture business, then box and lift weights, before heading to his Washington,
                        D.C., home. And then, COVID-19 almost killed him. Ayyad was on a ventilator at The Johns Hopkins
                        Hospital for 25 days and lost more than 60 pounds during his ordeal. His doctors say his
                        physical fitness, positive attitude and the support of friends and family are helping him
                        recover from the disease and the toll of long-term ventilation. Discharged on April 22, Ayyad
                        still has a blood clot in his left arm and damage to his heart and lungs — all complications of
                        COVID-19. But he is gradually putting on weight and has begun running and lifting weights. -

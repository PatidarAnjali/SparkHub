                    <p><span class=wellnessinfo>Practice Mindfulness<br><br></span>Mindfulness is the practice of being
                        aware of all that is going on in our mind and around us without explicitly reacting to anything.
                        We live each moment as full and rich. To practice mindfulness, bring all your attention to the
                        “now” and “present”. Be aware of each passing thought or feeling without judgement. Evidence
                        shows that practicing mindfulness in our day to day lives can significantly increase our
                        capacity to cope with traumatic events, improve control over our emotional states and reduce
                        anxiety and stress related symptoms.</p>

                    <p><span class=wellnessinfo>Set a Routine<br><br></span> though there are disruptions in our work
                        life and most of us are working from home, it is important to set and stick to routines.
                        Routines decrease stress and improve mental health. Your routine could include time to help your
                        children with learning, work from home, prepare meals, do chores, and healthy activities such as
                        exercise.</p>

                    <p><span class=wellnessinfo>Reach out to keep friendships close<br><br></span>Contact is important
                        for maintaining close friendships. Even if you’re staying at home more, you can still set a goal
                        to contact a couple of your friends every week. Make a call, text them, have an exchange using
                        social media, share coffee over FaceTime or Zoom — there are a number of ways to connect with
                        friends and keep them close at heart even when you’re social distancing.</p>

                        isolated and even abandoned. They may feel depressed, hurt and angry when friends and others in
                        their community avoid them for fear of getting COVID-19. Stigma harms people's health and
                        well-being in many ways. Stigmatized groups may often be deprived of the resources they need to
                        care for themselves and their families during a pandemic. And people who are worried about being
                        stigmatized may be less likely to get medical care.<br>→ Get facts about COVID-19 from reputable

                        as anxiety or depression will go away on their own can lead to worsening symptoms. If you have
                        concerns or if you experience worsening of mental health symptoms, ask for help when you need
                        it, and be upfront about how you're doing.<br>→ Call or use social media to contact a close
                        friend or loved one<br>→ Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone in your faith
